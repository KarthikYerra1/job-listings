## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - package bundler

### What I learned

I have written the below code 10 times in different ways. Still not satisfied with code size. Earlier codes was too long and after taking all constraints into one place, I have slowly wrote the below code which improves time complexity as well as space complexity.

```js
 const filterData = (skills) => {
    {/* Code goes here */}
    });
    setJobsData(newData);
  };
```
